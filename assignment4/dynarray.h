/* A DynArray consists of an array, along with its logical and
   physical lengths. 
   
   In user interaction-heavy programs like Shell, 
   responsiveness is important, so it's inefficient to individually allocate 
   tokens with malloc for each user input command.
   
   To improve this, we allocate and use blocks of memory in advance, 
   where iLength represents the logical length of the array 
   as seen by the user, and iPhysLength represents the physical length 
   of the actual allocated array. 
   
   This allows us to improve performance 
   by reducing the frequency of dynamic memory allocations. */
